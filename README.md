I am very interested in developing a workflow that lets me make full use of my old ChatGPT conversations. I am envisioning a process like the following:

1. Regularly import the conversations into Obsidian
2. Generate block embeddings for similar conversation retrieval using Smart Connections
3. Create maps of content in a separate directory, which both makes it easier to surface value and cognitively reinforces the content.

I tried Nexus AI Chat exporter, but I didn't love the format. I considered modifying it, but Typescript is not a language I'm strong in, and it doesn't have the ecosystem for data munging that Python does. So I decided to whip something up myself.
